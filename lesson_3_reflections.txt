>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
      Most commonly i use it for collaborating with other people on the same project.
      i also use them to share with someone even if they only want to see my code.
      i.e not only to get contributed by someone. i also use when 
      i want to be able to see my code from difrent computer and keep it up to date.
      remote repository can be a good way to keep backup of local data.
