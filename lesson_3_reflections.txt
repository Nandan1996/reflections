>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
      Most commonly i use it for collaborating with other people on the same project.
      i also use them to share with someone even if they only want to see my code.
      i.e not only to get contributed by someone. i also use when 
      i want to be able to see my code from difrent computer and keep it up to date.
      remote repository can be a good way to keep backup of local data.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to
 -date with your remote repository?

 	   Because it gives us facility when to except the thange,i.e it won't change automatically when i am working on code.
 	   Let suppose the new version of coode is broken,so the buggy code will automatically reflect into my local repositry,so i would like to pull it manually when the bug get fixed.
