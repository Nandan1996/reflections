>When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?
      Most commonly i use it for collaborating with other people on the same project.
      i also use them to share with someone even if they only want to see my code.
      i.e not only to get contributed by someone. i also use when 
      i want to be able to see my code from difrent computer and keep it up to date.
      remote repository can be a good way to keep backup of local data.

>Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to
 -date with your remote repository?

       Because it gives us facility when to except the thange,i.e it won't change automatically
       when i am working on code.Let suppose the new version of coode is broken,so the buggy code
       will automatically reflect into my local repositry,so i would like to pull it manually when
       the bug get fixed.

>Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of 
 another?

       forks - cloning a repositry of someone else on github server on my account.
       clones - to clone any git repositry to any where we have access to.
       branch - allow us to add changes in the same repositry.

       I use fork when it is not allowed to modify original one but i want to make changes public.
       i use clone when i want to work on a repository locally rather than using github website.
       i use branching when i want to add changes to reposity without affecting the existing
       version(master branch).i.e main production.
